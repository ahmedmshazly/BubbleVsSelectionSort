# Sorting Algorithms Comparison: Bubble Sort vs Selection Sort

This repository is dedicated to the comparison and analysis of two classic sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Selection Sort. It includes implementations, performance analysis, and a comparative study of these algorithms under various scenarios.

## Overview

The project aims to provide a clear understanding of how Bubble Sort and Selection Sort perform under different conditions. It includes pseudo code, implementation in Python, and a detailed analysis of their running times in best, average, and worst-case scenarios.

## Contents

- `bubbleSort.py`: Implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- `selectionSort.py`: Implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm.
- `performance_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the performance analysis and comparative study.
